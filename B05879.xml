            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This gray Devil Snoar'd as if he had been aſleep by me all the while, and I would have riſen but he would not let me; and as ſoon as it pleaſed God that I had power to wag or ſtir my ſelf, this horrible Imp or Devil vaniſhed out of my ſight, and then I was in good eaſe: Then I went down the Stairs to go about my work as well as I could, then was I ſoon taken with a moſt grievous pain in my Neck, and all the hinder ſide of my head being terribly pull'd, and fearfully torn; theſe pains held me all the Afternoon: then there came and appeared to me the black Devil, in a moſt horrible and frightful ſhape, while I was in this extream pulling and tareing pains; he ſaid not one word to me then, but ſtared in my face, and to he Vaniſhed, and as ſoon as he was gone away, my pains were abated.</p>

Moreover, Here is to be Noted, the wonderful Bleſſing and love of God to me, his poor Handmaid, That before this great affliction was laid upon me, I knew not any Letters in the Bible or Teſtament, but ſince my enduring this heavy puniſhment, (or Hell upon Earth) I can now learn my Book, and am wonderfully delighted in Reading and ſpending all my ſpare time in Prayers, and meditating on the word of God. For I was for the moſt part of my life much given to Prayers, and would often pray when I was alone and had leaſure, ſo that it was not for any vicious and wicked life that I have led (as it is well known to all that know me) that the Lord laid theſe fore Afflictions upon me, but, I hope for my good; knowing that <hi>Thoſe whom the Lord loveth he Chaſtizeth;</hi> So that my truſt may be always in the Lord my God, and my loſs may henceforth become my gain; for to my great comfort, I can now read the Divine word of God, which before I could not.</p>
